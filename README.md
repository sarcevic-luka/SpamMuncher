## Tech Talk üõ†Ô∏è
SpamMuncher is crafted with love using the latest and greatest in Swift, strictly adhering to the MVVM architecture that the new Swift loves so much. We've applied SOLID principles diligently to ensure our code is as robust as it is fun!

### Highlights & Features:
- **Number Management**: Easily add suspicious or blocked numbers. You can even import them from your contacts!
- **Dependency Injection**: We've kept it simple yet effective.
- **Storage**: For speed and simplicity, UserDefaults is our go-to. But in a parallel universe where SpamMuncher is battling real spam, we'd probably opt for CoreData.
- **Frameworks**: No external SPM frameworks were used, keeping it light and tight. But hey, in a real-world scenario, we might.
- **Local Flavors**: Say hello to `MunchUI` for delightful UI elements and `MunchModel` for, well, models!
- **UI Extravaganza**: We might have gone a tad overboard with custom UI elements like our segmented control. But hey, why not?
- **Number Formats**: Currently, we play nice with "+XXX XX XXXX XXX". Future SpamMuncher might juggle more complex formats.
- **Previews Galore**: Most views have their previews because we love instant gratification.
- **Testing**: One unit test to rule them all! Just to showcase our testing approach.
- **And More...** We've added a pinch of overengineering and a spoonful of fun, because why not?



- **Contributions**: Feel like adding a feature or squashing a bug? Pull requests are welcome!

## Final Thoughts üí≠
